Penetration testing, also called pen testing, goes a step ahead of vulnerability scanning in security assessment. Unlike vulnerability scanning, which examines the security of individual computers, network devices, or applications, penetration testing assesses the security model of the network as a whole. Penetration testing can reveal the potential consequences of a real attacker breaking into the accounts of network-to-network administrators, IT managers, and executives. It also sheds light on the security weaknesses missed in typical vulnerability scanning. [EC-Council]
